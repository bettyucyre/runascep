# How to Get Unbanned on RuneScape (2025 Guide) 🧙‍♂️✨

Getting banned from RuneScape can be a total nightmare, especially if you feel it was a huge mistake or just bad luck. Don’t panic! This easy-peasy guide will walk you through what to do if Jagex has slapped a ban on your account and how you can try to charm your way back into the game.

## Maybe You Are IP Banned? 🌐

Did your ban mysteriously pop up even when you made a brand-new account? Or are all your accounts getting booted from Gielinor faster than you can say “Dragon scimitar”? You might be **IP banned**! This means Jagex has blocked your internet connection’s address to stop you from reconnecting, making it tough to play no matter how many new accounts you make.

Using a reliable VPN can help you sneak past the IP block and get back to grinding those skills.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Dig through any emails or messages from Jagex to figure out why you got the boot. Typical reasons include:
- Botting or using third-party software  
- Real-world trading (RWT) or gold buying/selling  
- Abusive chat or breaking the community rules  

**Pro tip:** Review the official RuneScape rules and terms before firing off your appeal.
