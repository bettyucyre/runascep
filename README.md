<p>Getting banned from RuneScape can be a total nightmare, especially if you feel it was a huge mistake or just bad luck. Don’t panic! This easy-peasy guide will walk you through what to do if Jagex has slapped a ban on your account and how you can try to charm your way back into the game.</p>
<h2 id="maybe-you-are-ip-banned-">Maybe You Are IP Banned? 🌐</h2>
<p>Did your ban mysteriously pop up even when you made a brand-new account? Or are all your accounts getting booted from Gielinor faster than you can say “Dragon scimitar”? You might be <strong>IP banned</strong>! This means Jagex has blocked your internet connection’s address to stop you from reconnecting, making it tough to play no matter how many new accounts you make.</p>
